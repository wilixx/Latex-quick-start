### The purpose of this tutorial
Latex is a document format software which outperforms the most word processing tools such as MS word. Almost all of research publictions are using the latex rather than windows because the specificity of the markup language.
I myself prefer more about markdown for which is a human understandable language. But it can not mark a decent document to have double columns as the publisher required.

For learning this tool many of people around me feel difficult about it. So I made this tutorial to simplify the rountine and also save our time. Yes, time is money!
